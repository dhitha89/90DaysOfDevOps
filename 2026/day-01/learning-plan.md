Learning Plan:

1. Current Career level : 
- Senior fullstack PHP developer.
- I have a mixed backed background. I have Masters in Electrical Communication Engineering but with time ended as a software developer.

2. Purpose/reason:
- With recent years I got more inclined towards devops. 
- My previous job also involved working with CI/CD pipelines, rancher, vagrant and I mostly worked with Linux.
- With a small break during my Maternity I did more research on future for Devops and Completed my Diploma in Devops at Paris University.
- During my Diploma course I ended up watching a lot of Train with shubham videos which was very handy for understanding the concepts
- I ended up finding my current job which is combination of fullstack development plus Devops
- My reason behind taking this course is to deepen my Devops skills

3. Goal:
- Ultimate goal to become a **KUBESTRONAUT**. I trust this course would motivate me towards it
- Though I have a Diploma in Devops I still feel there are so many Devops topics which needs to be learnt but in depth.
- I want to be always ready to solve or provide a solution in my team when it comes to **efficient usage of resource, or automation or scaling**.

4. Devops Skills I am interested in:
- I do have experience with **DOCKER** but I want to excel in it.
- I want to be proficient with **KUBERNETES**
- I can create good **CI/CD pipelines** but sometimes with help of google, I want to be more confident on some advanced topics.
- I need better understanding of **Ansible** and **Terraform**.

5. Time Schedule:
- Everyday spend 1.5 -2 hrs for the course
- Weekends will try to atleast spend 4 hrs on the TWS topics
